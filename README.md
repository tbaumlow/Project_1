# Project_1
For Project 1, you will work with your group to find and analyze a dataset of your choice.

For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.

Finance
Exploratory data analysis is used by many individuals within the finance industry, including investment banking professionals, private equity analysts, lending analysts, financial administrators, and real estate professionals.

Exploratory data analysis is used for the following tasks in the financial sector:

Identifying deals

Analyzing private equity markets

Researching arbitrage opportunities

Evaluating liquidity

Keeping up to date with finance and refinance trends

Project Examples
Equity Trading: While working for a large equity-trading company, you’re tasked with researching a client’s portfolio. Your client wants to invest in telecom stocks and needs expert analysis to make the right decision. Using the Nasdaq Data APILinks to an external site., pull a year’s worth of trading data for the major cell phone providers: AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Which stocks are trending upward? Which are trending downward? Based on the data, what would you recommend to your client?

New-Car Loan Analysis: People have been financing higher car values over longer amounts of time. Explore what is driving this trend. Search for answers by using data collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)Links to an external site.. What other questions can you answer with the data? What do your results suggest about the time value of money? What about the impact of these loans as time goes on?

Healthcare
Exploratory data analysis is used by many individuals within the healthcare field, including clinical data analysts, pharmaceutical testers, healthcare-economics researchers, senior policy analysts, compliance operations analysts, and public health informatics scientists.

Exploratory data analysis is important for understanding the following healthcare considerations:

Predicting and diagnosing illnesses

Improving patient safety

Reducing time to diagnosis

Increasing our understanding of disease risks and causes

Developing stronger prevention strategies

Project Examples
Mental Health in Tech: People working in tech are often at their desks for extended amounts of time. Explore how this trend correlates with mental health. Examine the data collected through surveysLinks to an external site. and search for trends. Find out if there is a link between mental health and companies that offer wellness programs. What do the results show you about the state of mental health in tech? Can you suggest steps that companies can take to help their employees?

Personal Fitness Analyst: Research whether working out helps a person become more active overall. Use data collected by the Samsung Health applicationLinks to an external site. to uncover relevant trends. What do the results tell you about individuals using this app? Have their lifestyles become more active? Less? Remained the same?

Custom
We’ve only specified healthcare and finance, but any industry can benefit from exploratory data analysis.

The following professionals also use data and can benefit from exploratory data analysis:

Natural and environmental scientists

Marketing professionals

Information security analysts

Business intelligence analysts

Project Examples
Private Investigator: Use aggregate crime dataLinks to an external site. from different police precincts in a city to uncover criminal activity patterns. Consider that most crime in New York City takes place in the summerLinks to an external site.. Find out if you are able to uncover similar patterns in your city. What do your results suggest about how police should plan their patrols? What do your results suggest about how law enforcement resources should be distributed over the calendar year?

Uber Rides and Weather: No one likes to walk in subzero temperatures or scorching heat. Do people use Uber more when the weather is uncomfortable? Using Uber ride data from KaggleLinks to an external site. and data from a weather API, find out if people take Uber more during summer and winter months, and if there are relationships between daily temperature and ride frequency. What do the results tell you about surge-pricing strategies and commuter habits?

Working with Your Group
When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:

Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.

Set up an agile project by using GitHub ProjectsLinks to an external site. so that your group can track tasks.

Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

Project ideation

Data fetching/API integration

Data analysis

Testing

Creating documentation

Creating the presentation

Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project by the end of the first week in order to stay on track.

Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

Support and Resources
Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this first project.
